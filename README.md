# gnu-core-rewrite-practice

Aim
---
In this repo, I will try to rewrite near all, if not all, GNU Core Utilities library by just reading their documentation without reading any lines of code.
I will follow the list below, going from relatively easy softwares to harder ones. The list could be extended as of development:
| Software| Progress |
|---------|----------|
| echo    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| yes     | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| cat     | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| head    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| tail    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| pwd     | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| mkdir   | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| touch   | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| rm      | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| cp      | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| sort    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| uniq    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| find    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| grep    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| sed     | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| diff    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| tar     | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |

Reference Points:
-

For the manual, I will refer to man pages through terminal or GNU Core List manual:

Motivation
-
Not to the reinvent wheel, but to improve myself on my passions, job, hobbies.

|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                Neovim                | I will try to learn-by-doing Neovim throughout this project and use it as my main editor.                                                                                                            |
|               GNU Make               | As a build tool, I will utilize make, improving myself using it.                                                                                                                                     |
|          GNU Core Utilities          | As natural result of the project, at the end I will have a good grasp of knowledge about GNU Core Utilities, which will help me a lot since I use Linux daily.                                       |
|             Linux Shell              | In addition to core utilities, I will try to stay in Linux shell as much as I can so I will learn new things about GNU/Linux.                                                                        |
