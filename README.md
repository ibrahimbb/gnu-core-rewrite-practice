# gnu-core-rewrite-practice
In this repo, I will try to rewrite near all, if not all, GNU Core Utilities library by just reading their documentation without reading any lines of code.

I will follow the list below, going from relatively easy softwares to harder ones:

| Software| Progress |
|---------|----------|
| echo    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| yes     | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| cat     | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| head    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| tail    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| pwd     | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| mkdir   | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| touch   | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| rm      | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| cp      | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| sort    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| uniq    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| find    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| grep    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| sed     | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| diff    | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |
| tar     | ![](https://geps.dev/progress/0) |

The list would be extended as of development.

For the manual, I will refer to GNU Core List manual:
